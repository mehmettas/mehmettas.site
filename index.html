									<h3>Cent - Kotlin MVVM - Side Project</h3>
									<p>While developing this project, I focused on using all the benefits of Kotlin and applying it by following the software architectural pattern: MVVM. I tried to decrease the dependencies between my classes by applying Kotlin-Koin and for asynchronous programming I used Kotlin-Coroutines. After all, dealing with all this data, I used one of the android architecture component "LiveData" to make my application lifecycle aware.</p>

						<h2>Currently studying Computer Science and developing Android Apps</h2>
						<p>Hi there! This is Mehmet Tas from Istanbul/Turkey. I am a 21 years old Computer Science student who is passionate and energetic about software development. I did my first practices when I was studying Web development at technical high school. After I graduated, I had some interests on python and this kind of languages during the first year of my University Education, then in the summertime of 2017 I went to the USA, I worked as a kitchen assistant for 4 months to improve my real world and foreign language skills, that was awesome! When I turn back from the USA I decided to be focused on something that I was interested in which is mobile development. After this consideration, I started working on Android Development and since then I still work on that. During this period I attended many hackathons, events, tech talk, I got some awards from some of these (1 First place,2 Third Place,1 First Five) and I keep attending these kinds of events because I love the communities and being interacted with real work life. In 2018 summer time, I did a 4 Month intern as an Android developer and this was super helpful for me. I had the chance of being a part of a big project and I learned a lot. As a summary, I am really excited to see what I will do with my job in the coming years before and after I graduated from University!</p>
